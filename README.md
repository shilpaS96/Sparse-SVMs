> Sparse Support Vector Machines with Pinball loss (Pin-SSVM)

published at [ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT) 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21613915) 

## Abstract in brief:
The proposed Pin-SSVM employs L1-norm in the SVM classifier with the pinball loss (Pin-SVM), which ensures the robustness, sparseness, and noise insensitivity of the model.
