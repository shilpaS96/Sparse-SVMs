> Sparse Support Vector Machines with Pinball loss (Pin-SSVM)

published at [ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT) 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21613915) 

## Abstract in brief:
The proposed Pin-SSVM employs L1-norm in the SVM classifier with the pinball loss (Pin-SVM), which ensures the robustness, sparseness, and noise insensitivity of the model. The proposed Pin-SSVM eradicates the need to solve the dual as we simply obtain its solution by solving a linear programming problem (LPP). The proposed Pin-SSVM does not spend more computational time as that of Pin-SVM. Hence, solving an LPP with two linear inequality constraints does not affect the computational complexity.
